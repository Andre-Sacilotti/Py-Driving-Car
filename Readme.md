# Autonomous Car in Python

This project are one of my studies, where i'm trying to make an self-driving
 car, with openCV and Tensorflow in Python and Carla Simulator
 
## What has been done so far

![Image showing a two windows, where the first have an car, and the seconds have an car with green lines in the road](images/img1.png)

## Usage

Its underwork, but, if you want, just run 

```
python mainv2.py
```

And place the game in a 600x600 windows, in the top-left 


## TODO

- Easy start, without need to change game resolution and position in screen
- Improve Lane Finder 
    - Fit Polynomial Equation on Curves
    - Improve the image processing for stable detection
- Pedestrian, vehicle and signs detection, probabily using YOLO
- Reinforcment learning for driving
